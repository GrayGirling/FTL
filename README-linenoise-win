This version of linenoise has been modified by Gray Girling to attempt
some support for Windows.

It uses direct console access in Win32 to obtain raw access to the keyboard.
Unforutnately this is far from a useful start:
  * the console access does not work properly in e.g. cygwin consoles
  * the console access does not provide arrow key input
  * none of the code that assumes that the console interprets VT100 escape codes
    is valid in windows - a separate library will be needed to implement the
    various actions

Perhaps there is some mileage in using PDCurses from
https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses

As it stands this library is not usable under Windows.
