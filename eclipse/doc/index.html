<h1>Using Eclipse to Develop FTL Code</h1>

<p>Eclipse is a powerful Integrated Development Environment that you can use to
write, develop and debug C applications (among other things) on your Windows,
Mac or Linux computer.</p>

<p>Find out (much) more about it <a href="https://eclipse.org/">here</a> and
download the 'lunar' release <a
href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/lunasr1a">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ways in which Eclipse can be used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To develop the FTL library</li>
  <li>To develop a new FTL-using utility</li>
</ol>

<p>Before you can build libraries or utilities in C or C++ you will need to
ensure that your operating system has the appropriate tools installed. This
process is described in the documentation at <a
href="../../doc/FTL-build-setup.html">FTL-build-setup</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Eclipse Workspace Location</h1>

<p>The Eclipse projects provided are designed to be placed in a subdirectory
held in the same directory as the Git source. (That is both the Eclipse
workspace subdirectory and the git subdirectory should be in the same
directory.)</p>

<p>For example the following commands would create two directories 'FTL' and
'ws' for the git sources and the Eclipse workspace respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">git clone https://github.com/GrayGirling/FTL.git</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">mkdir ws</p>

<p>Once created you should select the sibling directory ('ws' above) as the
workspace Eclipse normally asks for when it starts. (If your Eclipse does not
use File &gt; Change Workspace... to select it after it starts.)</p>

<h1>Developing a new FTL-using utility</h1>

<p>Two Eclipse projects are available to import from the 'ecliipse'
subdirectory of the FTL git repository. They are</p>
<ul>
  <li>ftl_bin_dev - this project contains pre-compiled versions of the FTL
    library and their associated headers</li>
  <li>ftl_cmd - this project contains a simple example project for creating the
    FTL-using utility called 'ftl' - all it does is supports ftl commands. You
    can use it as a proforma for developing your own utility.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a new workspace it will contain no projects. To import these
projects in to the workspace use File &gt; Import ... then select the type of
import you want to make under General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace
(Next&gt;). Use the 'select archive file' radio button and browse to
FTL/eclipse where you can select the relevant project.</p>

<p>Do this for both the above projects.</p>

<p>After archive ftl_bin_dev.zip is imported the following projects will
appear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>release_Debug - containing the binaries and headers to use when building
    utilities for debug; and</li>
  <li>release_Release - containing the non-debug binraries and headers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On importing the ftl_cmd-project.zip file this project will be created</p>
<ul>
  <li>ftl_cmd - containing the source of a simple utility 'ftl'. </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many versions of the utility that can be built depending on which
operating system you use. To select the one you want to build select the
ftl_lib project and right-click selecting Build Configurations &gt; Set Active.
The name of each build configuration is made up of three parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Release_ or Debug_ depending on whether you need a debuggable version of
    the utility</li>
  <li>Linux, Mac or MinGW depending on which operating system you are using
    (use MinGW for Windows)</li>
  <li>Optionally '_norl' for versions that do not use the 'readline' library
    (and are therefore not subject to its licensing conditions)</li>
</ol>

<p>For example a version for debugging on Linux with 'readline' support will be
built with the build configuration 'Debug_Linux'.</p>

<p>Once you have set the active project you can clean and/or build it by
selecting the relevant entry when right-clicking on the project.</p>

<p>The utility created by the build will be copied in to your workspace
directory
'release_&lt;Release|Debug&gt;/&lt;operating_system&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;/bin'.</p>

<p>The code files in this project can be found in your workspace. They are a
copy of those in the git repository, and updating them has no effect on the
versions held by git. You may safely, for example, rename 'ftl.c' to the name
of your own utility. You can also rename the project.</p>

<p></p>

<h1>Developing the FTL Library</h1>

<p>Two Eclipse projects are available to import from the 'eclipse' subdirectory
of the FTL git repository. They are</p>
<ul>
  <li>ftl_bin_dev - this project contains pre-compiled versions of the FTL
    library and their associated headers.</li>
  <li>ftl_lib-project - this project contains the FTL library source. When it
    is built it copies new content into ftl_bin_dev.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a new workspace it will contain no projects. To import these
projects in to the workspace use File &gt; Import ... then select the type of
import you want to make under General &gt; Existing Projects into Workspace
(Next&gt;). Use the 'select archive file' radio button and browse to
FTL/eclipse where you can select the relevant project.</p>

<p>Do this for both the above projects.</p>

<p>After archive ftl_bin_dev.zip is imported the following projects will
appear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>release_Debug - containing the binaries and headers to use when building
    utilities for debug; and</li>
  <li>release_Release - containing the non-debug binraries and headers.</li>
</ul>

<p>On importing archive ftl_lib-project.zip this project will appear:</p>

<p>ftl_lib - containing the source of the FTL library.</p>

<p>When ftl_lib is built binaries are copied into the relevant "release_'
project (where it can be picked up by FTL-using utilities)</p>

<p>As well as debug and non-debug releases the library can support the open
source 'readline' library. When it does support this library and commands are
typed to a FTL-using utility it is possible to access a line history and
perform a fair amount of line editing. These features are not necessarily
available when 'readline' is not provided.</p>

<p>Your system must be able to provide 'readline' in order to build the
readline versions of the libraries (e.g. Windows does not). Also, because
readline is available through a GNU Public License (GPL) there are some
restrictions about what you can do with the utility you build. (Essentially you
may have to make its source publically available.)</p>

<p>There are four versions of the library that can be built:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a debug version without any 'readline' support (libftln)</li>
  <li>a debug version with 'readline' support (libftl)</li>
  <li>a non-debug version without any "readline' support (libftln)</li>
  <li>a non-debug version with 'readline' support (libftl)</li>
</ul>

<p>The one that is to be built can be selected by a debug configuration (select
the ftl_lib project and right-click selecting Build Configurations &gt; Set
Active).</p>

<p>Before you can use Eclipse to build any of the above you will need to set
the toolset appropriately. You can do this by selecting the ftl_lib project and
right-click selecting Properties. Expand the C/C++ Build section and select
Tool Chain Editor. In that dialogue under 'Current Toolchain' select the </p>

<p>following from the dropdown list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>on Windows select 'MinGW GCC'</li>
  <li>on Linux select 'Linux GCC'</li>
  <li>on Mac OSX select 'MacOSX GCC'</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have set the active project you can clean and/or build it by
selecting the relevant entry when right-clicking on the project.</p>

<p>The library created by the build will be copied in to your workspace
directory
'release_&lt;Release|Debug&gt;/&lt;operating_system&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;/lib'.</p>

<p>If you have an Eclipse project to build your own utility project set up as
above it will use the new library when it is cleaned and rebuilt.</p>
